# 🧠 How Machines Learn - A Simple Introduction

Welcome to a beginner-friendly machine learning example that helps you **understand how machines learn** patterns from data using a real, working Python script.

This project uses a simple linear regression model to learn the pattern:

## 🔍 What's Inside?

- `how_machines_learn.py` — A short Python script that:
  - Trains a machine learning model on simple data
  - Predicts a value
  - Shows the exact formula it learned

- Beginner-friendly explanations in comments

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/prathameshholay/machineLearning.git
cd machineLearning

python -m venv venv

# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate


pip install scikit-learn numpy


python how_machines_learn.py

🧠 What You’ll Learn
What it means for a machine to "learn"

How data is used to find patterns

The basics of regression and prediction

🧠 General Principle:
The model doesn't "know" the formula ahead of time — it just analyzes the data you give it, and finds the best-fitting straight line.

Even if your data is noisy or inconsistent, it'll still try to find the best possible line that "averages out" the relationship.

here the machine learns the pattern of changes and guesses the next prediction asked. like for 13 it will give 29 as an answer.
