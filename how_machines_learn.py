# Starting with importing required packages
# 1. scikit-learn's LinearRegression class â€” this lets the machine learn a pattern (like y = 2x + 3)
# 2. numpy â€” used for handling numerical data and arrays

# Go to terminal and follow these steps to run the code:

"""
1. Navigate to your repo folder:
   cd "D:\machine learning basics\machineLearning"

2. (Optional but recommended) Create a virtual environment:
   python -m venv venv

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   On Windows:
       venv\Scripts\activate
   On macOS/Linux:
       source venv/bin/activate

4. Install required packages:
   pip install scikit-learn numpy

5. Run the Python file:
   python how_machines_learn.py

ðŸ§  How Machines Learn - Simple Example

Imagine you give someone these pairs of numbers:
    x: 1 â†’ y: 5
    x: 2 â†’ y: 7
    x: 3 â†’ y: 9

Now you ask them:
    "What do you think y would be if x = 6?"

This is basically what machines do. They look at patterns in the data and try to learn the relationship.
In this example, weâ€™ll teach a machine to learn that y = 2x + 3.
