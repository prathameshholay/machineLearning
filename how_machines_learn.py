#EXPLAINATION
"""
ðŸ§  How Machines Learn - Simple Example

Imagine you give someone these pairs of numbers:
    x: 1 â†’ y: 5
    x: 2 â†’ y: 7
    x: 3 â†’ y: 9

Now you ask them:
    "What do you think y would be if x = 6?"

This is basically what machines do. They look at patterns in the data and try to learn the relationship.
In this example, weâ€™ll teach a machine to learn that y = 2x + 3.
